The code heavily borrows from other great projects.
I actually did not write much of this myself but basically just combined,
stripped down and cleaned up already existent codebases (to some of which 
i contributed code in the past that I re-used here though).
Since all used projects are MIT-licensed and I consider my own code changes and
additions MIT-licensed as well, the whole backend is MIT-licensed.
